D3 Tutorial
===========

Experimenting with D3 data-vis library and Weather API.  

Going through the tutorial at http://alignedleft.com/tutorials/d3 
and adding my own spin on it by hooking it up to the OpenWeather API http://openweathermap.org/api
to get some data.  

Currently just returns simple bar graphs of one month worth of temperature readings from a weather station.
